# Video Games Sales Analysis

In my project, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize video game sales data from a dataset with about 70,000 rows and 11 columns, including attributes like rank, name, platform, year, genre, publisher, and total sales. I created a flexible **"Zone Sales"** parameter that allows users to select different sales categories, utilizing a **CASE statement** for dynamic display. The dashboard features visualizations that compare **Year** and the selected **Zone Sales**, with filters to exclude null values. I enhanced interactivity by adding **Start Date** and **End Date** parameters for date range selection, as well as visualizations for the **Top 10 Video Game Sales**, **Top 10 Publishers**, and **Top 10 Platforms**, creating an engaging and insightful user experience.
